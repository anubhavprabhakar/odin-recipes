    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>To make the chole, drain the chickpeas and rinse them well.</li>
        <li>In a pressure cooker, combine the chickpeas, onion, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, red chili powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add enough water to cover the chickpeas by 2 inches.</li>
        <li>Close the pressure cooker and cook on high heat for 3 whistles.</li>
        <li>Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then release any remaining pressure manually.</li>
        <li>Open the pressure cooker and mash the chickpeas with a fork or potato masher until they are smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chole and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until heated through.</li>
        <li>To make the bhature, whisk together the flour, curd, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the water and stir until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
